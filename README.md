This was a final assignment from IBM's Data Analyst Professional course. I worked with real-life data sets for the City of Chicago and was tasked with effectively formulating queries from a Python enviroment and analyzing / answering questions. 


Before the assignment, I was tasked with connecting the Jupyter notebook to a database using an API. In this case, I worked with ibm_db API and used the SQL Alchemy for the connection and Jupyter Magics to simplify the queries inside the Python environment.
